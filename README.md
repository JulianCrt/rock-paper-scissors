### Software: 
* JavaScript
* HTML
* CSS (to be implemented)


### Tools
* GitHub
* StackOverFlow

### Result :heavy_check_mark:
I made the well-known game: Rock, Paper, Scissors by using the JavaScript program. The game takes the player input by clicking one of the three options and then gives a randomised computer result and checks who is the winner of the round. Also, whoever gets the score of 5 first, the program nominates him as the winner.

## Summary

### What I have learned.

a. Be as descriptive and concise as possible when naming your function names. eg. getComputerChoice. This way, you won't need to add too many comments to explain your work.

b. Create a function for every action. Clean coding is very important in order to be easy to debugg and for other coders to understand it. 

b1. Test your functions everytime before moving on so you will make sure it work (console.log does wonders).

c. Registering HTML buttons to JavaScript Functions. It was the hardest problem I had to overcome during this project (I did it!!).

d. Creating elements in JavaScript and appending them to the HTML.
